AGRICULTURE MONITORING AND IRRIGATION SYSTEM![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94218410/148664828-28fe0ec4-23a4-4377-b161-774473efb467.png)



HOMEPAGE

For the farmer to interact with the software, we made a software homepage which shows the average temperature, moisture and humidity of the sections which can be redirected to the dashboard.

DASHBOARD

The dashboard shows the simplified view of the field. The farmer can analyse the condition of the crops.



OPTIMUM MOISTURE MAKER

*Using a sensor across the field, the moisture in the soil is recorded at that particular temperature and humidity.
*Optimum value of moisture of the soil at that particular temperature and humidity is calculated for a specific plant 
*Found by storing, monitoring and processing the data from all the previous readings of the plant.
*A motor of the irrigation system turns on and provides the required water to the plant if recorded moisture is less than optimum.
*For eg: In the afternoon time if we provide the same moisture level as morning or evening, it may cause the plant to wilt and lose its turgidity.

IMAGE PROCESSING

*Using OpenCV, Image processing of a leaf from the plant is done.
*If the leaf is a full green leaf, it is said to be healthy and sector is shown in green.
*If the leaf is yellow, the plant has irrigation problems and sector is shown in orange.
*If brown or black spots are found in the leaf the plant is said to have a plant disease and sector is shown in red.
*Image processing is used to rate the crop on the basis of the quality of leaves which is used for calculating the optimum moisture.

ADVANTAGE

Makes the farmer notice the areas where there are irrigation problems and spreading diseases.
Facilitates the farmer to monitor all parts of the field at a glance
Helps him to selectively give more attention to the problematic areas.
Increases yield percentage and crop quality.
Aids the efficient use of resources.
